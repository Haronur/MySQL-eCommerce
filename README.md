## OK, so what can it do?

This is not designed to support international currency. It is designed for use in the USA (and the US Dollar), but if it will work in a different country/currency, you are free to try it. Remember to follow all local and federal regulations on transactions and record-keeping.

Store & Catalog your entire inventory.

Stores and automates pricing information on all products in your catalog, including base-price, seasonal pricing, discounts, etc.

Maintain information on all website users, including account information, credit cards, billing & shipping addresses, contact information, etc.

No 'group accounts', or in other words, it's designed for one account per person.

## Features I might support in future releases

Support for tax-exempt entities, as well as 'group accounts' or other entities, rather than just 'individual accounts'.
